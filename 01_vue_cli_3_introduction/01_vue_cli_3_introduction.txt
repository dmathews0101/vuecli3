# vue cli 3

1. new version of vue cli - version 3, and that comes with some improvements and
many new features
2. rundown of noticeable new features, then each one in detail
3. creating a project : 
vue init template-name app-name
old cli: vue init webpack-simple myapp
new cli: vue create myapp
4. we dont use templates now, when we create a new vue app using vue create, we 
get 2 options... option 1 : default preset --eslint, babel, ... option 2 :
custom preset (using custom preset to add extra features to our vue application
setup) -- vuex, vue router, pwa support, etc
5. once we have created our project, vue still abstracts the webpack configuration
--webpack configuration
-webpack config abstracted away (hidden)
-can tweak webpack config through vue.config.js file
-can also edit the config indirectly with the use of plugins
-this use of plugins now allows us to easily edit the configuration of our project
at any point during the development without having to manually go into the webpack 
file and configure things ourselves
-plugins are like dependencies, but they can also edit our webpack config files 
and source files too, and they can also add extra commands to the cli
-another cool feature - instant prototyping
-graphical user interface

-installing new cli and create a new project with it
